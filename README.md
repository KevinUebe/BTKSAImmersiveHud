# BTKSAImmersiveHud
Immersive Hud mod for VRChat, only displays the hud when notifications come in or a state changes (Mic mute/unmute, Gesture lock).

You can configure the duration that the hud stays visible, and disable the entire mod, from [UIExpanionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods)

## Install/Usage
Install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader) version 0.2.6 or higher, it does require 0.2.6 as it has migrated to the new MelonPrefs and MelonLogger classes.

Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/ddakebono/BTKSAGestureMod/releases) and place in your VRChat\Mods folder.

## Disclamer
**Warning:** The VRChat team is not very keen on modding or reverse engineering the game, while the mod does not include anything that would ruin the fun for others, using it may still be a bannable offence.

**USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**, I am not responsible for any bans or any punishments you may get by using this mod!
